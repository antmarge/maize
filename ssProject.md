## Project To Do List

- [ ] Create signature of selection LD/Haplotype [figure](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006178)
          - [ ] Plot qvalues
          - [ ] Plot LD blocks from Haploview
          - [ ] Sliding window (7 SNPs) for focal SNP 
          - [ ] Plot difference in lines (Parental and DH lines) for allele frequencies
          - [ ] Calculate theta threshold as done in Muir 2016 Plos Genetics
